Your task:
Select the 5 stories that have the highest potential impact on a global travel 
technology company (covering OTA distribution, airline partnerships, payments,

in the next 12–24 months.

Evaluate impact based on:
- Revenue opportunities

**Headline**
- Why this matters for travel tech (2–3 bullets)

- Risk level: Low / Medium / High
- Time horizon: Immediate / 6–12 months / 1–2 years
